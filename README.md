# Shoo-in

A React Native app used to collect digital stamps in a stamp rally.

**This was created during our time as students at Code Chrysalis.**

## How it works

A user can use this app to take part in stamp rallies. Their progress is stored on a CRUD server separate from this app.

## Getting started

First, fork and clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/stamp-rally.git
```

You will need Expo to build this app.

### Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io/) is an SDK which extends the functionality of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It is also used to build native binaries and handle assets. Make sure both the command-line tools and the [XDE](https://xde-updates.exponentjs.com/download/) are installed.

Expo requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Simulators

To be able to run the app locally, simulators are required. For iOS, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) will need to be installed (macOS only). For Android, we recommend the use of [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).

## Starting the app

Once Expo is installed, the app can be started opening the cloned directory in Expo XDE. Expo XDE will build and serve the app. It can be opened in the simulators using
