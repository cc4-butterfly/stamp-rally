# Shoo-in

A React Native app used to collect digital stamps in a stamp rally.

**This was created during our time as students at Code Chrysalis.**

## How it works

A user can use this app to take part in stamp rallies. Their progress is stored on a CRUD server separate from this app.

## Getting started

First, fork and clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/stamp-rally.git
```

You will need Expo to build this app.

### Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io/) is an SDK which extends the functionality of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It is also used to build native binaries and handle assets. Development with Expo requires both a local development tool and a mobile client to open the app.

Expo requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed in order to build apps.

### Local Development Tool: XDE

Make sure both the command-line tools and the [XDE](https://xde-updates.exponentjs.com/download/) are installed.

### Mobile Client: Expo for iOS and Android

Expo Client allows you to view your projects while you are developing them. When you serve your project from XDE, it generates a dev URL that you can open in Expo Client to preview the app. It is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [iOS](https://itunes.com/apps/exponent).

To be able to run the app locally, simulators are required. For iOS, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) will need to be installed (macOS only). For Android, we recommend the use of [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).

## Starting the app

Once Expo is installed, the app can be started opening the cloned directory in Expo XDE. Expo XDE will build and serve the app.
